## Description
“During the mechanical ages we had extended our bodies in space.  […]
In the electric age we have abolished time as well. […]
Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extensions of man - the technological simulation of consciousness”
 “Understanding Media”, 1963 M. McLuhan

It all started while reading the book "VEHICLES: Experiments in Synthetic Psycology", 1984 V.Braitenberg: in this short text the author describes a series of minimal vehicles in order of increasing behavioural complexity (ie. starts with a thermic sensor connected to the wheels speed / ends with multiple conditional sensors). I've always been working at the intersection of technology and creativity and I feel my aim as an artist is to present this relation to the audience in a way that can enable them to deconstruct the technological complexity, see how creation and code/logic/electronics are parts of a same vision.
For this project I am planning to create a series of minimal vehicles, each sensing a different aspect of the surrounding environment. The automata will all wirelessly communicate to a central brain that will tell them where to go, record the data received, analyse it, store it and visualise it. This “brain” will be based on cloud/Google technologies.
As a painter creates a landscape (complexity) combining a series of paint strokes (simplicity) so my automata (simple actions) will create their representation of what surrounds them (complex result). While the forming actions are completely transparent and easy to grasp in their singularity the combined result will be overwhelmingly complex, inextricable, beautiful.
NOTE: Especially because I will be using cloud-based / Google technologies, my emphasis will be on recreating a process similar to that of networks/the cloud/internet (so do not expect mechatronic arms painting a portrait).
